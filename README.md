# NetworkWrapper
Basic Networkwrapper. Implement this into your Client and see what happens. Use it as Libary and this code:

Use this on your Client:
Server server = new Server();
server.Initialize(params);

Use this on your Server Application:
Client client = new Client();
client.Initialize(params);

With the .sendMessage(message) in the Interface you can send a message to the Server and use it as Command. 
The Libary is on test!!!!

I will notify you here for Updates and new Features
